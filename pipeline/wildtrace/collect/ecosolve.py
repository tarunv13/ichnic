"""Offered online vs caught: ECO-SOLVE adverts set against Ichnic enforcement cases.

ECO-SOLVE (Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, EU-funded) records adverts for
protected wildlife on online platforms through regional data hubs, and publishes its advert table on
its public dashboard (https://www.ecosolve.eco/dashboard, "download"). Ichnic records where trade
met enforcement. This module maps each advert to a Ichnic species group and counts, per group and
country, adverts against enforcement cases in the same period.

The ratio is not a detection rate: the two sources watch different things with different effort, and
ECO-SOLVE's hubs choose their species and platforms. It shows where wildlife is openly offered while
little reaches the news record of seizures and arrests, which is where to look next.

Only aggregated counts are published (web/data/online_gap.json, .csv), attributed to ECO-SOLVE. The
advert rows stay in data/raw/ecosolve, which is not published. The advert table carries no seller
names, handles or links.
