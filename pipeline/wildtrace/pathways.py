"""Risk pathways: wildlife crime as an environment-to-security risk, with the evidence for each link.

The Oxford Agile Initiative's "Environment and National Security: Exploring the Risk Pathways"
(September 2026) maps how environmental damage reaches national security through causal
pathways, and notes that its diagrams "could be linked to a database showing relevant evidence
for each link". Its research agenda names environmental crime once, as a revenue source for
hostile actors and organised crime (R1.37), and asks whether "animal life" and
"revenue-generating uses" belong in the weaponisation of nature (R5.2, R5.3).

This page does that linking for the wildlife-crime pathway. Every link carries a number taken
from WildTrace's published data at build time, a strength rating for the open evidence, the
limit that stops the number meaning more, and the research question it speaks to. Where the
open evidence runs out, the page says so: that is where research is needed, and a claim that
outruns its evidence is how conservation gets securitised and militarised (Duffy 2015;
Lunstrum 2014; Massé et al. 2020).

Written as `web/pathways.html` by every build, so its figures never go stale.

<h1>Wildlife crime as an environment-to-security risk: seven links, and the evidence for each</h1>
<p class="lede">{esc(lede_hook)} That last number is the story: nature is taken and moved at scale, and the record goes quiet
  where money and accountability begin.</p>
<div class="answer"><h2>The short answer</h2><ul>
  <li>Wildlife crime reaches security through <b>seven links</b>, from extraction to crime revenue, disease risk and the erosion of ecosystems.</li>
  <li><b>{n_strong} links are well evidenced</b> in open data; <b>{len(n_gap)} is a gap</b>: who profits, and how much ({esc(n_gap[0]['title'].lower()) if n_gap else ''}).</li>
  <li>Plants are {_pct(e.get('cites_plants', 0), e.get('cites', 0))} of CITES seizures but {_pct(e['plant_cases'], e['cases'])} of news cases: the pathway is greener than the headlines.</li>
  <li>Security framing must not become militarisation: evidence first, rights respected, no person named.</li></ul></div>

<h2>Where the evidence runs out</h2>
<p>The gaps are the research agenda. Open data cannot yet show who profits from wildlife crime, how much wildlife is taken
  rather than seized, or how removals cascade through ecosystems. Language technology can narrow some gaps: extracting several
  events from one report, telling a sale from a condemnation or a news story, and checking claims against evidence.
  <a href="https://github.com/tarunv13/wildtrace/blob/main/docs/RESEARCH_AGENDA.md">Read the open research agenda</a> and pick a question.</p>
<h2>Security without militarisation</h2>
<p>Calling wildlife crime a security threat can bring money and attention. It has also justified shoot-on-sight policies, the
  exclusion of local people from land they depend on, and "war by conservation" (Duffy 2015; Lunstrum 2014). WildTrace takes the
  security frame with three commitments: every claim carries its evidence and its limits; enforcement is counted, never glorified, and
  no accused person is named; and the harms to people who live alongside wildlife are part of the pathway, not a side effect.</p>
<h2>What can be done</h2>
<p>The research agenda sorts interventions into six kinds. For this pathway they look like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Information and foresight:</b> open observatories that grade evidence, like this one, and early warning for new species and routes.</li>
  <li><b>Regulation and standards:</b> due diligence for timber and wildlife supply chains, and consistent seizure reporting by every CITES Party.</li>
  <li><b>Capacity-building:</b> customs, port and postal inspection where routes converge, and forensic identification of seized products.</li>
  <li><b>Governance and coordination:</b> environment, health and security departments reading the same evidence, not three silos.</li>
  <li><b>Incentives:</b> livelihoods for the communities who live with wildlife, so that protection pays more than extraction.</li>
  <li><b>Communication:</b> local cases linked to the system they belong to, uncertainty stated as a range, and public concern made visible.</li>
</ul>
