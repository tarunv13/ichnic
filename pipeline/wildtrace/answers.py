"""Questions WildTrace answers: computed from the published data at every build.

Every answer has the same shape, so the Atlas, the static pages and answer engines read it the same
way (docs/VOICE.md): the question; who it is for; a one-sentence answer with its number; a small
chart; who answers it (the sources, with their standing); what the number cannot tell you; and where
to explore it on the map. Figures are never typed in: a question whose data is missing is skipped.

Output: web/data/answers.json (the Atlas) and web/answers/<slug>.html (crawlable, citable).
