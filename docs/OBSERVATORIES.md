# The observatory network

Ichnic is one observatory among many. This document explains what the others
do, how each one feeds Ichnic's pipeline and design, and which principles the
project takes from them. The machine-readable registry is
[`pipeline/wildtrace/resources/observatories.yaml`](../pipeline/wildtrace/resources/observatories.yaml).
The site's **Network** section renders it.

## Where the list came from, and how it was checked

The registry combines three inputs:

1. the project owner's spreadsheet `illegal_wildlife_trade_observatories_comprehensive_2026.xlsx` (15 rows),
2. notes from a Google Gemini conversation (September 2026),
3. Ichnic's own collector registry (`sources.yaml`).

Inputs 1 and 2 were produced by a language model, so on 2026-09-22 every entry
was re-checked. The HTTP status was tested, and the page was read to see whether
it does what the entry claims. Corrections are stored in each entry's `status.note`
and shown on its card:

| Entry | What the input said | What we found |
|---|---|---|
| TRAFFIC Wildlife Trade Portal | link to a 2020 TRAFFIC Bulletin PDF | portal is `wildlifetradeportal.org` |
| SHERLOC | `illegalwildlifetradeprojects.org` | that is the World Bank GWP map; SHERLOC is `sherloc.unodc.org` |
| ECO-SOLVE | `/initiatives/eco-solve/` | 404; correct path `/initiatives/ecosolve/` |
| Wildlife Witness | active | Taronga says the app is offline; old URL 404 |
| WCS global monitor | "fully active", secure uploads | the page calls itself a demonstration base; e-mail submission |
| #WildEye | maps "all of Europe and Asia" | main map is Europe; separate regional maps |
| TimberStats, WILDTRADE | own domains | domains did not resolve; used TRAFFIC's launch page / CORDIS |
| Wildlife Sentinel | aviation reporting app | no official page found: kept as **unverified** |
| Codewords ("striped T-shirt", "four-wheeler", "teh", "penny" …) | "verified public list" | no primary source found: **watchlist only** |

## How each kind of observatory feeds Ichnic

| Stage | What happens | Observatories that inform it |
|---|---|---|
| **Collect** | news, official feeds, online listings, bulk trade data | GDELT, Google News (opt-in), YouTube (opt-in), CITES Trade DB, Indian Kanoon (planned) |
| **Screen** | is this an IWT signal? | OWT labelled set (training), PMC8579131 names, ECO-SOLVE / WILDTRADE methods, Coalition policy on codewords |
| **Extract** | species, place, route, quantity, mode, agency | GeoNames, C4ADS & ROUTES transport framing, Species+ (planned), EIA convictions |
| **Link** | cases → entities → networks | WJC / Oxpeckers / Operation Jaguar as seed networks; TRAFFIC portal & ETIS as benchmarks |
| **Publish** | privacy gate, static site | SMART's open-code / closed-data split |
| **Design** | how people move through it | WCS Brasil dashboard (structure), #WildEye (case lifecycle), TradeMapper (bring your own data), OpenHiggsfield (motion) |
| **Governance** | what not to publish, where to report | Coalition to End Wildlife Trafficking Online, WildScan, ENV hotline, WCCB |

## Principles taken from the network

1. **Open code, closed operations** (SMART, NGO data sharing). Software, methods and aggregates are public. Names, informants and patrol data are not.
2. **A machine ranks, a person decides** (ECO-SOLVE hubs, WILDTRADE). Classifier plus review queue plus relabel loop.
3. **Follow the logistics** (C4ADS, ROUTES). Every case records transport mode and route.
4. **Follow the case to court** (#WildEye, SHERLOC). A case's kind moves from seizure to arrest to conviction.
5. **Bridge source and demand** (PMC8579131, EIA, Operation Jaguar). Map local names to taxa and taxa to end uses, so source-country listings and demand-country seizures meet in one chart.
6. **Verify before you trust.** LLM-supplied claims are checked, corrections are shown, and unverified terms never drive automation.

## Ichnic and ECO-SOLVE: two ends of the same trade

ECO-SOLVE (GI-TOC, EU-funded) is the most complete open view of wildlife adverts online. Ichnic does not
try to copy it. The two record different moments of the same trade, and read together they show something
neither shows alone: which online markets are advertised heavily but rarely reach enforcement.

| | ECO-SOLVE Global Monitoring System | Ichnic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| What is recorded | adverts for protected wildlife online | seizures, arrests, convictions and rescues; seized shipments (CITES, US ports) |
| Moment in the trade | offer (supply online) | interception and outcome (enforcement), online and offline |
| Scale | 30,934 adverts in the public dashboard data (14 Apr 2024 - 24 Sep 2026; the sixth trend report cites 21,900+ adverts and 266,000+ products on 61 platforms to Mar 2026) | 1,871 audited cases from public reports; 24,786 CITES and 19,346 US port seizure records |
| Where | 11 hubs (Thailand, Indonesia, Mexico, South Asia, Colombia, South Africa, Brazil, Nigeria, MENA, Cameroon, Czechia) | 61 countries in news (9 languages incl. Thai); every CITES Party; US ports |
| Species | 440 species names, animals only (no plants) | 40 groups, fauna and flora, plus every CITES-listed taxon in trade records |
| Evidence per record | analyst-verified adverts | graded per case (official, corroborated, single report) with sources |
| Update | periodic releases | daily, automated, versioned with DOIs |
| Beyond the trade | legal ambiguity, deception patterns | security pathways, disease risk, legal-trade baseline |
| Code | not open | MIT, reproducible pipeline |

**Measured together** (`wildtrace ecosolve`, [`online_gap.csv`](https://tarunv13.github.io/ichnic/data/online_gap.csv)):
90% of adverts map to a Ichnic group. Bears in Thailand: 1,303 adverts, 0 Ichnic cases; parrots and
songbirds in Thailand: 1,046 adverts, 0 cases; tigers in Thailand: 2,232 adverts, 3 cases. A third of the
adverts are in Thai, which Ichnic did not read before this comparison; it does now.

**What Ichnic adds to the picture:** the enforcement end of online trade. Since v1.9.0 every case records
the platforms its reports name (never the seller), and multilingual searches look for online wildlife crime
that reached police, customs or courts in eight languages. Set against ECO-SOLVE's advert counts, this can
show the gap between where wildlife is offered and where anyone is caught.

**What Ichnic does not do:** monitor adverts. Scraping marketplaces raises consent and platform-terms
problems that ECO-SOLVE's hubs and WILDTRADE handle with their own safeguards; Ichnic links to them.

## Adding an observatory

Add an entry to `observatories.yaml` with `status.state` and `status.checked`,
plus a `wildtrace.how` that says concretely which stage it serves. An entry that
cannot say how it helps goes in with `role: []` so the gap stays visible.
